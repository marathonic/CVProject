# CV Project

## My experience:
This project was built as part of the Odin Project curriculum, where we are tasked with using class-based React components.
In preparation for this app, I read the React docs and spent a few days building simple apps from scratch with React Hooks, whilst also reading online resources to further familiarize myself with the inner workings of the framework.
Once I was somewhat comfortable using Hooks on my own, I started building the CV App. 
Using the old class-based approach instead of the more polished Hooks further deepened my understanding of managing state. 


## Problems solved:

Built a few apps using React Hooks.
Learned to use class-based React components.
Gained greater understanding of the state object.
Understood what makes components re-render when their state changes.

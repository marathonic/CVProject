# CV Project

## My experience:
This project was built as part of the Odin Project curriculum, where we are tasked with using class-based React components.  

In preparation for this app, I read the React docs and spent a few days building simple apps from scratch,  
whilst reading online resources to further familiarize myself with the inner workings of the framework.

## Problems solved:

Built a few apps using React Hooks.  
Learned to use class-based React components.  
Gained experience with managing state, passing props and conditional rendering.  
Understood what makes components re-render when their state changes.  
After building the app using only class components, refactored everything to use only hooks.
